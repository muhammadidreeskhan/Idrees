# PWA Icons Instructions

You need to create the following PWA icons:

1. `icon-192x192.png` - 192x192 pixels
2. `icon-512x512.png` - 512x512 pixels

These should be square PNG images with your logo or brand. For best results:

- Use your primary brand color as background (#10B981)
- Ensure the logo is centered with adequate padding
- Save as PNG format with transparency

You can use any image editing software like Photoshop, GIMP, or online tools like Canva to create these icons.

For a quick solution, you can use the following service to generate the icons:

1. Go to https://favicon.io/ or https://app.iconify.design/
2. Upload your logo or create an icon
3. Download the generated package
4. Resize and rename the icons as needed
